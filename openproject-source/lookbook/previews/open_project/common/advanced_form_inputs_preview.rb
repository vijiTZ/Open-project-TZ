      # HTML forms do not submit unchecked checkboxes, so when every option in an
      # array-valued `check_box_group` is unchecked, the field key is absent from
      # the request params entirely. The server then has no way to distinguish
      # "user cleared all selections" from "this field was not part of the form",
      # and the previous value is silently preserved.
      #
      # Pass `include_hidden: true` to emit a hidden sentinel field before the
      # checkboxes. This mirrors the behaviour of Rails' own `check_box` helper
      # and ensures the key is always present in params — as an empty array when
      # nothing is checked — so the server can save the empty selection correctly.
